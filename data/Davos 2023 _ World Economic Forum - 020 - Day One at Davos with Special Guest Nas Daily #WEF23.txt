This is day one from Davos. This year I am shocked at how diverse the buildings are. There are four buildings that belong to India one that belongs to the Emirates, another for Indonesia, another for Poland, another for South Africa. This is the beautiful thing about Davos is that it's not just Europe. It's not just America. That's part of the global conversation. Everybody is here to participate on politics, economy, climate change, things that matter for everybody around the world. So the next time you think of Davos, don't just think Europe think the world
